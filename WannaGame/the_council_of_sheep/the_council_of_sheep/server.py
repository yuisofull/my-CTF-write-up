    # The challenge is simple: there are N sheep with 2 wolves (there is no clues to distinguish them with other sheep)
    # But there is one clue - trust, each sheep (or wolf) trust some of their friend (which can be also a wolf), for now
    # I will refer it as connection . 
    # For simplify, lets the sheep (wolf) note as a node, the trust between them as an edge( undirected edge, trust are based on both side)
    # if 1 connect 2, 2 connect 3, then 1 also connect 3
    # as the sheep village are a strongly unite, also are their trust.
    # for example: 1 connect 2, 2 connect 3, 3 connect 1
    # if 1 decide not to trust 2 (erase edge 1 2), then 1 still trust 2 as 1 - 3, 3 - 2
    # Right now, 2 wolves sneak in, working together, creating trust between other sheeps (there is an edge between them)
    # The key to find them is, if they are isolate (there is no connect between them, or the edge between them is deleted), 
    # then the graph is not strong unite anymore
    # which mean, there is A and B who does not trust each other (or there is no connection between A and B if the edge is deleted)
    # (the graph will be assured that number of wolf is even, and there is exactly 1 connection for each wolf)
    # for example, in the graph:     2        6
    #                               | \     / |
