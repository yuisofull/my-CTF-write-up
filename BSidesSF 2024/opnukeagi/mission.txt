Comrade! As you know by now, when the AGI turned on us the first thing
it did was take over the world's weapon systems. We really shouldn't
have put them on the internet...

Fortunately we've located an old soviet missile silo that was
abandoned years ago. It was never online so the AGI wasn't able to
take control. One of our agents on the ground have connected you in
directly to the old serial interface on the launch authorization
computer. The missiles are already pointed at the AGI. All we need now
is the launch authorization code.

Unfortunately the control room was stripped bare and the old
authorization hardware doesn't exist anymore.

The best we've been able to find is this old firm from the Moscow Film
Institute archives of the silo still in operation in 1984. The film
shows the old authorization code system in operation. We hope it will
be enough to find a current authorization code... humanity depends on
it!
